## Tutorial

### Create a spreadsheet

Create a spreadsheet on Google Sheets… Then, follow these rules:
- Set each sheet with 2 columns and define a fixed header with the first line. Name each column as you wish
- Keep this structure!

Here an example of a [well-formatted spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1srDnvM8Wt7vzicCyrRxyDGsgU8KVlA30h2_2WUdv50Y/edit#gid=0).

### Publish to the web

The spreadsheet must be public, to avoid any authentication and allow Sketch to pick a cell:
- Go to `File > Publish to the web`
- Click `Publish`

### Link this spreadsheet

Once published:
- Copy the spreadsheet's URL (⚠️from the URL bar!)
- On Sketch, go to `Plugins > Awesome ipsums > Sync. ipsums from a Google spreadsheet`
- Paste the URL into the text field

## Just why?

**Lorem ipsum** is often used to simulate content into a designed web page. Nevertheless, there may be some issues:
- It does not make any sense
- It is quite boring and repetitive

**Lorem ipsum** could be fun, relevant, and fully personalized. A design team can create, collect and reuse his own fake content. How to get this team involved in collecting content?
👉An online spreadsheet, because it is easy to maintain and always up-to-date.
