## Tutorial

### Create the spreadsheet

Set a spreadsheet on Google Sheets… Then, follow these rules:
- Set each sheet with 2 columns and define a fixed header with the first line. Name each column as you wish
- Keep this structure!

Here an example of a [well-formatted spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1srDnvM8Wt7vzicCyrRxyDGsgU8KVlA30h2_2WUdv50Y/edit#gid=0).

### Publish on the web

The spreadsheet must be public, to avoid any authentication and allow Sketch to pick a cell:
- Go to the `File > Publish to the web`
- Click `Publish`

### Link this spreadsheet

Once published:
- Copy the spreadsheet's URL (from the URL bar)
- On Sketch, go to `Plugins > Awesome ipsums > Sync. ipsums from a Google Sheets`
- Paste the URL into the text field

## Just why?

**Lorem ipsum** is often used to design UI, by adding fake text in it. Nevertheless, there are some issues:
- It does not make any sense
- It is quite boring and repetitive

**Lorem ipsum** could be fun, relevant, and fully personalized. How to involve a team to create, collect and reuse his own content. An online spreadsheet works well because it is always reachable and up-to-date.
